        "- Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm mainly used for classification problems, especially binary classification. Instead of predicting a continuous value, it predicts the probability that an observation belongs to a particular class (such as 0 or 1). It uses the sigmoid (logistic) function to convert a linear combination of input variables into a value between 0 and 1.\n",
        "How Logistic Regression Differs from Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference lies in what they predict. Linear regression predicts a continuous numerical value, such as price or salary, while logistic regression predicts a probability used for classification, such as whether an email is spam or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear regression uses a straight-line equation and can produce any real value from negative to positive infinity. Logistic regression, on the other hand, passes the linear equation through a sigmoid function, ensuring outputs stay between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another key difference is in how errors are measured. Linear regression minimizes the sum of squared errors, whereas logistic regression uses log loss (cross-entropy), which is better suited for probability-based classification tasks.\n",
